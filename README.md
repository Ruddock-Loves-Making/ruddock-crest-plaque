# Ruddock Crest Plaque

This is a collection of STL and OBJ files of a Ruddock House plaque for 3D printing. The original design can be found on [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/eQNwdROub6r ), with some files also available on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3127481).

The `double` and `separate` files are intended for dual-color printing with a dual extrusion merge, while the `single` file can be printed in one color and post-processed, or [printed with the color swapped mid-print](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/ruddock/forums/3d-printing/topic:40223).

Please note that the `separate` files are two whole objects, so (possibly depending on your slicer) the middle layers between the bottom of the `top` and the top of the `base` will be printed as whole layers. The `double` files are "hollow" and so infill will fill the gap between the bottom and the top.
